# Basic-State-Transition-Algorithm
State transition algorithm (STA) is a new metaheuristic method, which is used for global optimization with box constraints without the derivative information.  
min f(x)  
s.t. lb <= x <= ub  
This is a MATLAB implementation of the basic state transition algorithm for continuous optimization.
