# Basic-State-Transition-Algorithm
State transition algorithm (STA) is a new metaheuristic method, which is used for global optimization with box constraints without the derivative information.  
$\min f(x)$  
$\mathrm{s.t.}  x_{lb} \leq x \leq x_{ub}$  
This is a MATLAB implementation of the basic state transition algorithm for continuous optimization.
